# ASD-Testing
Clinical software for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) test administration (ITALIAN)


This software was created as a project for a Master's thesis in Computer and Automation engineering. It was created for the C.R.R.A. Abruzzo, in L'Aquila AQ (Italy), to help with patient administration and testing, allowing also for external testing for statistical purposes.

The project is database centered, and most of the business logic is centered around database stored procedures. The front end uses Bootstrap for cross device compatibility.


Database: MySQL
Server scripting: PHP
Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap
